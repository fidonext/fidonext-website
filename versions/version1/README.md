# FidoNext Website — Version 1 Snapshot

This folder stores the November 2025 state of the landing page before the redesign inspired by Solana.com. It contains:

- `src/pages/index.astro` — complete Astro page with the original hero, mission, roadmap, hiring copy.
- `src/styles/global.css` — the monochrome mesh visual language (Space Grotesk/Inter, node grid, glow gradients).
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` — base HTML shell with meta tags and favicon links.

You can render this snapshot by temporarily pointing Astro to these files (e.g., replace the root `src` with this version) or by manually copying sections back into the live codebase.

All content corresponds to the “Version 1” brief:

- Hero copy mentions “Fast messages, files, media, low-latency audio and video calls”.
- Contact CTA uses `dev@fidonext.org`.
- Mission and Human-first sections describe on-device LLM moderation for public channels.
- Architecture section was removed in favor of the layered narrative inside Roadmap.

Use this snapshot as a reference if you need to restore specific styling decisions or textual phrasing from the original landing page.
